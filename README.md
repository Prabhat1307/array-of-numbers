# array-of-numbers


Write a program that takes as input an array of numbers of length N and a number p (positions - p is greater than 0 
and less than N) and a number d (direction - either 0 for left or 1 for right). The objective is to return the array 
shifted by p positions in d direction.
Example: For an input array [1, 3, 2, 7, 4, 6] with p=3 and d=0
the expected result would be [7, 4, 6, 1, 3, 2] with the array shifted left by 3 positions.
